## What is this about ?

This is personal notes about my pentesting / red teaming / ctf challenges experiments so far that involve playing with various tools and techniques used by ctf players, penetration testers, red teams and advanced adversaries.

This is a work in progress...

## Goal

The goal of this project is simple: regroup most of the common/uncommon attacking techniques at hand, instead of looking for hours on the internet.

> Do not take everything or anything for granted nor expect the notes to be very detailed, so always consult additional resources.
